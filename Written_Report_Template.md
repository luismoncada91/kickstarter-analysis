## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to showcase different scenarios to provide Kickstarter Company information on the performances of the campaigns that they have had. With a glance at the KPIs, Louise or anyone within the company can evaluate them, and make their forecasts.
## Analysis and Challenges

I think that having an international company with different projects with various industries' database might be challenging when trying to understand behaviors and identifying patterns. To clarify the last point, I think that the behavior of people across regions is different, so making comparisons of the industry could be tricky.

## Results


- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

First, I think this chart is helpful for everyone who is trying to understand the behavior of the outcomes depending on the launch date, looking at the trends I can tell that the Theater Category has 61% of successful campaigns which is higher than the failed ones, so it is a good indicator for the company.

Looking at the Months of Launching, May and June have the best rates so I would encourage Kickstarter to focus on maintaining these rates and look for different strategies within the rest of the months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

![launchdates_graph](Resources\Outcomes_vs_Goals.png).

Here I can say that 69% of projects are concentrated between Goals "Less than 1.000" and from "1000 to 4999", these projects have a percentage of successful projects is above 70%, these goals have the highest rates of Successful campaign, considering this information, I would highly recommend looking at the best practices to apply on the failed projects. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

It should be interesting to analyze why people are not interested in the projects that failed, so having more qualitative information could give a more complete analysis.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?


As Kickstarting is a company that funds different projects, I would recommend having a Dashboard with all the relevant information at the beginning and diving deeper if necessary.

My perspective is that we could have the same "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" but instead of looking at the Months, I would recommend having a year-over-year graphic, so everyone can be aware of the behavior of the projects between years.
